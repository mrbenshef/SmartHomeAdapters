\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|p{\colWidth}|}
	\hline
	\cellcolor{blue!25}\large
	\textbf{What were your goals?}
	\\ \hline
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Web server 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Create Alexa skills schema
			\item Add Alexa endpoints for receiving Alexa requests
			\item Endpoint for unlocking/locking bolt lock
		\end{itemize}
		\item Android
		\begin{itemize}
			\item UI for unlocking/locking bolt lock
			\item Send request to lock/unlock bolt lock
		\end{itemize}
		\item Robot
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 3D print case for controller
			\item 3D print light switch grip
			\item Build grip to manipulate bolt lock
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

	We have for this demo also tackled the following issues, which were not explicit goals for this demo:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item OAuth for authentication (to allow for Alexa integration)
		\item Restucturing the robot code to allow for \textit{deep sleep} (to improve battery life)
		\item Develop a mock-up for better app UI and testing this on potential users
		\item Add buttons for manually causing the robots to move
	\end{itemize}

% ------------ORGANISATION----------

\begin{tabular}{|p{\colWidth}|}
	\hline
	\cellcolor{blue!25}\large
	\textbf{Summarise how your group organised the workload to achieve your goals.}
	\\ \hline
	
		We achieved our goals by distributing them across the team in the following manner:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Web Server:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Alexa endpoint: {\color{red} ???}
					\item Endpoint for unlocking/locking bolt lock: Gwion
					\item OAuth: Gwion, Ben
					\item Changes to the robotserver to accomodate deep sleep: Ben
				\end{itemize}
			\item Android:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item UI \& server integration for unlocking/locking a bolt lock: thanks to good software architecture previously in the project, this did not involve making any changes to the app code.
					\item Using OAuth for authentication: Theo
					\item UI mock-up and user testing of this: Ben, Theo
				\end{itemize}
			\item Robot:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item 3D-printing: Luke
				\item Changes to the robot code: Ben, Theo
				\item Buttons for manual robot control: Spencer
				\item Bolt lock mechanism: {\color{red} ???}
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

		As before we are still using GitHub's \textit{Projects} feature to track our progress on the software side, along with communicating on Slack and in our weekly meetings.
		This is the current state of our progress according to the \textit{Projects} tracking feature, as of 12/3/2019.

		\begin{tabular}{| c || c | c | c |} \hline
			\textbf{Section} & \textbf{Remaining cards} & \textbf{Cards in progress} & \textbf{Finished cards}\\ \hline
			Robot & 1 & 1 & 4 \\
			Web server & 10 & 5 & 11 \\
			Android App & 5 & 1 & 19 \\ \hline
		\end{tabular}

		\vspace{3mm}

		Note that these \textit{cards} do not map directly to our demo goals; for example one of the web server cards is \textit{Create API specification for Smart Home Adapter clients},
		which doesn't lend itself to be targeted for a certain demo as the API specification will need to be changed as we add and modify functionality.

		After internal discussion we have realised that we may have to give up on the \textit{Triggers} feature,
		i.e. the user being able to set up rules such as "raise the thermostat by 2 degrees if the temperature ever drops below 20",
		or "turn the lights on when the sun sets".

		This is because there is a lot of work remaining in order to hit our demo 4 goals, particularly on the hardware side. As our project
		has progressed we have wanted to move further and further towards a finished product to promote the fact that our product has a real place in the market.
		However, this has meant that we have had to undertake very laborious tasks such as 3D-printing and PCB design, and therefore we may
		have to cut functionality elsewhere.
