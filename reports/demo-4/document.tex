		For this demo, we focused our goals around polishing our existing systems.
		The following is a complete breakdown of what aspects we aimed at improving:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Web server:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item New UI for OAuth web page
				\item Refactor existing systems to make them more easily extendable
				\item Make changes to accommodate new UI
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Add real names to user accounts (to welcome them with in the app)
					\item Endpoint to delete a robot from the user's account
					\item Endpoint to recalibrate a robot already registered to the user
					\item Endpoint to rename a robot already registered to the user
					\item Return robot statuses when fetching all robots
				\end{itemize}
				\item Penetration testing analysis
			\end{itemize}
			\item Android app:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Implement new UI
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Move to single-main-page architecture
					\item Interact with robots directly from the main page
					\item New Robot Registration Wizard UI
					\item New Login/Registration activity UI
					\item Horizontal list for configuration parameters
				\end{itemize}
				\item Automatically deploy signed APKS to GitHub Releases when a commit is pushed into the master branch
				\item Add support for some non-English languages/locales
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Chinese
					\item Swedish
					\item Japanese
					\item German
				\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}
			\item Robot:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Prepare set-up for final demonstration
				\item 3D-printed HAL design
				\item Final 3D-printed mechanisms for Switch, Thermostat, and Boltlock PALs
				\item Complete PCB design
				\item Light sleep for the ESP, to reduce power draw
				\item Final power consumption analysis
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

		As before, we largely allocated tasks according to the following structure:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Web server:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textit{New UI for OAuth web page}: Ben
				\item \textit{Refactor existing systems to make them more easily extendable}: Ben, Gwion
				\item \textit{Make changes to accommodate new UI}: Gwion, Ben
				\item \textit{Penetration testing analysis}: Gwion
			\end{itemize}
			\item Android app:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textit{Implementation of the new UI}: Theo
				\item \textit{Design of the new UI}: Ben
				\item \textit{Translations}: Han, Theo, and various friends of Spencer's
			\end{itemize}
			\item Robot:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textit{Prepare set-up for final demonstration}: Han
				\item \textit{3D-printing}: Luke
				\item \textit{Complete PCB design}: Spencer
				\item \textit{Light sleep for the ESP, to reduce power draw}: Xiaobin, Spencer
				\item \textit{Final power consumption analysis}: Spencer, Xiaobin
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

		We've also continued to make heavy use of our Slack channel and GitHub Projects to keep track of
		everyone's progress. However, for this demo we made an increased effort to work together on-site in
		Appleton Tower. We have thus spent a lot more hours than usual working side-by-side, which we felt was
		necessary as we near the end of the project.
