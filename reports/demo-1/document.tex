		Here is a summary of are goals for demo 1 from are project plan.

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Web server 
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Register user with email and password
					\item Authenticate the user and return token
					\item Store the state of the switch
					\item Endpoint for turning light on/off
					\item Endpoint for retrieving a list of robots
					\item Establish WebSocket with robot
					\item Send servo commands on light on/off request
				\end{itemize}
			\item Android
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Login/register UI
					\item Send auth token in REST requests
					\item UI to display a list of robots
					\item Light switch toggle UI
					\item Send light on/off request
				\end{itemize}
			\item Robot
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Establish websocket with server
					\item Receive servo commands
					\item Construct the LEGO switch gripper
					\item Connect the servo to Arduino
					\item Create temporary client on DICE to forward servo commands (since the Arduino we have doesnâ€™t have a Wifi chip)
				\end{itemize}

		We split into 3 teams corresponding to the components of the project: web server, android and robot.
		\newline\newline
		The robot team is comprised of Luke, Spencer, Han, Wang and Sameer. The team spent most of the time iterating on the LEGO frame to hold the electronics. Ben was responsible for the code to receive messages and drive the servo, aswell as the robot client to relay messages from the webserver.
		\newline\newline
		Theo and Ben worked on the android app. Theo created the authentication UI and Ben worked on the robot and robot list UI.
		\newline\newline
		The web server team is Ben and Gwion. They built the infustructure that we will need in order to deliver the more complex features in later demos. Ben completed the robot server (sends commands to robot via a web socket), user server (registration, login and authentication), switch server (recording the state of the switch) and client server (REST API that the android app works with). Gwion was responsible for the info server (infomation about the robot, e.g. its nickname, the owner, etc).

		We did not expect the lego gripper to be as difficult to construct as it was. With this in mind we will want to start prototyping the thermostat grip as soon as possible. If the 3D printed switch grip is finished within the first week we may want to refocus our efforts from LEGO to 3D printing the thermostat grip.
